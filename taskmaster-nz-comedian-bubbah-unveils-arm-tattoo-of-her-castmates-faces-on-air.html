Sieni Leo’o Olo’s forearm.</p><p>But the question on all of our lips was: was it real?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/RppPtjZfapLbJP4Uyqv-u68k7ak=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/ULRNAHLNFJCG5DM6TFKANMPFNE.png"><p>The challenge, as set by Taskmaster Jeremy Wells, was to bring the most unbelievable thing to the table.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The brief was broad and the comedians brought a range of items to the challenge: a certificate claiming Ray could do a backflip; a VHS; Karen’s confession that she would turn straight for either John Campbell or Jeremy Wells (circa Newsboy, not now); a <i>Ripley’s Believe It Or Not</i> book (with edits).</p><p>But Bubbah - also known as the iconic Tina from Turners - well and truly took the cake.</p><p>“When you look at Ray, Mel, Karen, Dai and I, we’re not a group of friends that you would see at an arcade or just hanging out, it’s a very random group. Will our friendship last?” she queried.</p><p>“I’ve decided for us. You wouldn’t believe this,” she continued, before an image of her tattoo was shown on screen and she bared her forearm to prove it.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/2Cg3dphdTdCky9gl4i-Td-Pm5j4=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LNB6TY2RTBC6PBVAYH2F6BQLI4.png"><p>Of course, Bubbah claimed the win and five points as her prize.</p><p>And speaking to the <i>Herald</i> today, she reveals the tattoo could have turned out quite differently.</p><p>“When I got the challenge, it was the most unbelievable thing - and I really wanted to get in contact with Jason Momoa,” she shares.</p><p>“I really wanted to get something Samoan, or a sheep, tattooed on our a****s,” she laughs.</p><p>“I chased him down. I was so close, because New Zealand’s so two degrees of connection. And I got so close and then I think he was out of town or something. But I didn’t get to him, I was so close to him.</p><p>“So a few days before, I messaged production like, ‘Can you pay for this tattoo?’”</p><p>Unbelievable as the tattoo itself was, it’s perhaps more unbelievable that she missed Momoa - who has been popping up all over New Zealand in recent months, from <a href=#>a hot tub in Queenstown</a> to <a href=#>the top of the Sky Tower</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/f3y_zV03AAZ5BN2zvplw1eIKKy0=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/NUDLUG4WUZE4ZKFMNN24J55MYA.JPG"><p>It was a bold move to make so early in the game - has it upped the stakes for her fellow comedians?</p><p>“I think so, but I have a feeling that that was my best ride, so I might have shot myself in the foot,” she jokes.</p><p>“And I got it on the day that we were shooting. So after that, don’t expect much, guys.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But even after the cameras stopped rolling, her castmates couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Karen still did not believe that it was real until the end... she thought it was fake, that it was like a sticker of some sort,” she shares.</p><p>“I think they were all just shocked at first and I think it became something that everyone loved.</p><p>“My family were just like, ‘you’re stupid, you will regret it’!”</p><p>But while there are no regrets, she admits that it’s hard to have tattoos as an actor - “so maybe I should train myself to cover up my own tattoos.”</p><p>So, if a new Turner’s ad comes out in the near future, you probably won’t spot the Taskmaster cast in tattoo form.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><i><b>Taskmaster NZ screens on Monday and Tuesday nights on TVNZ2 from 7.30pm</b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBor%2FKppisrJWneq%2FGjJympp2Unq6vecGumZuZmGLCr8LEoqOsZZGnum7AwK2rqKddpLNutMSrZJyZo6m6osDErGSfmZOawG67zWaYoqpfeZx2mZGGe255enyYkZSpioxrj4CBmZidopJm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1970s-slang-terms.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Are the '70s Slang Terms Every Kid From That Era Will Remember</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabi-garcia-weight-loss-journey-2023-before-after.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gabi Garcia Weight Loss Journey 2023: Before And After Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
