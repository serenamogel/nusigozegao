In a recent interview, Buster Murdaugh has finally broken his silence to set the record straight on the rumors and allegations that have surrounded their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/maugiaoso9-bd.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2MImWRmhJV.jpg><h2></h2><p>For months, Buster Murdaugh kept silent about speculation about his involvement in Stephen Smith’s death. However, he has now decided to address the allegations directly. He wants everyone to know that he firmly believes that his father, Alex Murdaugh, is not guilty of the murders of his mother, Margaret “Maggie” Murdaugh, and his brother, Paul Murdaugh. Buster’s decision to speak out is an attempt to clear his name and set the record straight about the rumors surrounding him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/maugiaoso9-bd.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/JWrCXm4d2D.jpg><h2></h2><p>One of the most important aspects that Buster wants to address is the nature of his relationship with Stephen Smith.

He asked the interviewers, “I don’t want to be rude here, but have you ever been accused of killing someone?” It is clear that the weight of the accusations was very heavy for him, as it cast a shadow over his reputation and caused people to view him as a potential murderer.</p><figure></figure><h2></h2><p>Despite his father, Alex Murdaugh, being convicted in June 2021 and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, Buster remains steadfast in his belief that his father is innocent. He admits that Alex may have flaws but does not consider him a cold-blooded killer. Buster continues to question whether the real killer is still free, casting doubt on the outcome of his father’s trial.</p><h2></h2><p>Buster also criticized Judge Newman for comments made at the end of the trial. He felt that the judge “went too far” in his comments about Alex visiting Paul and Maggie while he was sleeping.

This further shows the complexity of the case and the doubts that remain in the minds of those involved.</p><h2></h2><p>The relationship between Stephen Smith and Buster Murdaugh is a story filled with questions, rumors, and a search for the truth.
