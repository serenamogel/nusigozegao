She represented Wyoming’s at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2017 to 2023 and served as chair of the House Republican Conference—the third-highest position in the House Republican leadership—from 2019 to 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-liz-cheney-biography><strong>Liz Cheney biography</strong></h2><p>During the George W. Bush administration, Liz Cheney held various positions within the U.S. State Department, including Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and Coordinator for Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiatives.</p><p>She played a significant role in advocating for regime change in Iran while leading the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group alongside Elliott Abrams. In 2009, Cheney co-founded Keep America Safe, a nonprofit organization focused on national security issues that supported the positions of the Bush-Cheney administration.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Although she initially ran for the U.S. Senate in Wyoming in 2014, challenging incumbent Mike Enzi, she later withdrew from the race. In the House of Representatives, she occupied the same seat previously held by her father from 1979 to 1989.</p><p>Recognized as a prominent conservative figure in the Bush-Cheney tradition and a representative of the Republican establishment, Cheney is known for her pro-business stance, emphasis on national security, unwavering support for the U.S. military, and assertive foreign policy views. She was once regarded as a leader within the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party and consistently supported the overall agenda of former President Donald Trump, despite occasionally criticizing his administration’s foreign policy.</p><p>Cheney notably backed the second impeachment of Donald Trump due to his involvement in the storming of the U.S. Capitol in 2021. Her stance on the Capitol riot, impeachment vote, and opposition to Trump’s false claims of a stolen election led to multiple attempts by pro-Trump members of the House Republican Conference, particularly those from the Freedom Caucus, to remove her from party leadership.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy supporting her removal, Cheney was ultimately ousted from her position in May 2021. In July 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Cheney to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, and she later became the vice chair of the committee. As a result of her service on the Select Committee, Cheney’s role has been significantly impacted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-liz-cheney><strong>What happened to Liz Cheney?</strong></h2><p>Liz Cheney expressed her determination on Tuesday to take all required measures to prevent former President Donald Trump from reclaiming the presidency. This commitment comes as she carefully considers the possibility of running as a third-party candidate in the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>“There’s a huge amount of work to be done after this election cycle, whether it’s rebuilding the Republican Party – which increasingly looks like, you know, maybe an impossible task—or helping to begin a new party that’s very focused on what the Republican Party used to stand for before this cult of personality. But right now and in this election cycle, I’ll do whatever I have to do to make sure Donald Trump’s not elected,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”</p><p>Cheney, an outspoken critic of Trump, said a third-party challenge in 2024 should be considered, but warned that uniting against the former president “can’t be a partisan issue.”</p><p>“We’re at a moment where the possibility of a third-party run is something we have to consider more than we ever have before because of the threat that Trump poses,” she said. “But I also think we have to ensure that at some point, we’re unified against him. It has to be a situation where we say, ‘I don’t care what your view is on this issue or that issue or whatever the big policy issue is. If you care about the Constitution and you’re going the defend it, we have to work and vote together for that.’”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-liz-cheney-net-worth><strong>What is Liz Cheney net worth?</strong></h2><p>Liz Cheney‘s&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;is $20 million.&nbsp;Cheney has been chosen as one of the distinguished individuals featured in the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, which recognizes remarkable entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are above the age of 50.
