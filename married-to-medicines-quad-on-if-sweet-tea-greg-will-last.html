But Heavenly is about what’s good for the show and she thought that bringing the girl on the show would be good for the show and she knows that if the girl ever tries me, she’s done.”</p><p>According to Quad, she’s “really happy” for LaTeasha and Greg, despite her past marriage to the latter.</p><p>“I hope they do well and have an everlasting relationship,” she stated.</p><p>And while fellow guest Heavenly made it clear that she was not convinced the couple will last, Quad says she “[thinks]” they’ll make it to the reunion before suspecting a pregnancy announcement will be made soon.</p><p>“I think they’re gonna try diligently to work on that. They want another season so they’re gonna try hard,” she suggested.</p><p>Quad then shaded LaTeasha and Greg’s wedding, saying her bubble bath “was giving luxurious” and she “didn’t see that much at the wedding,” and she noted that LaTeasha is better suited for her former spouse because she’s “palatable and easily to be influenced by him.”</p><p>Continuing on, Quad told host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> that LaTeasha’s style is “jive-y” and added that she’s the cast member most in need of a stylist.</p><p>“I’m gonna say T. She needs to learn not to leave tags on the clothing,” Quad stated, noting that she’s also the most guilty of sporting fake designer duds.</p><p>Then, after refusing to answer how she fits in intellectually, Quad responded to Heavenly’s suggestion that LaTeasha is “too damn honest” about being out for money.</p><p>“‘Well what do you like most about being engaged to a doctor?’ … ‘Access to a lot of money.’ She did say it,” Quad noted.</p><p>Also on the live broadcast, Quadd said Heavenly is “most likely to leak stories to press” and called her co-star out for saying she “[sleeps] around and [sleeps] with people’s men.”</p><p>Later, on the <a href=# rel=noopener>WWHL: After Show</a>, Quad responded to <strong>Dr. Jackie Walters</strong> saying she only sees or speaks to friends when it is convenient.</p><p>“That’s completely not true and that’s insinuating I use my friends. I love my friends,” Quad clarified. “There has never been a time I’ve been called upon or invited that I did not show up so I’ve got to tell you that’s an untrue statement. I love my friends. But here’s the thing: If they’re not trying to interact with me and I’m seeing things like them hanging out with my ex’s new fiancé or whoever, it makes me feel a certain kind of way as well.”</p><p>Married to Medicine season 10 airs Sundays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6topZGnv6qxw2arqGWdmrGqr8innKxloaqupXnOp2Sinl2oxKax02arnpldnL%2Bms4ywoKWkXaGutMCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-harris-bio-wife-age-net-worth-podcast-youtube-quotes-and-books.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Harris Bio, Wife, Age, Net Worth, Podcast, YouTube, Quotes, and Books</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halloween-h20-deleted-scene-jamie-lloyd-canon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halloween H20 Deleted Scene Wouldve Kept Jamie Lloyd Canon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
