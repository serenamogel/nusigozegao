They even look alike: both have pronounced (prosthetic) brows, puffy cheeks, and jagged snaggleteeth. Sadly, their mutually exaggerated appearances—as well as how their monstrous nature is mercilessly sensationalized by writer/director <a href=#>Ali Abbasi</a> and his co-writers Isabella Eklof and John Alvide Lindqvist—is so off-putting that I often found it hard to sympathize with Tina and Vore.</p><p>"Border" is Tina's story. We see the ugly, mundane world through her eyes (lit mostly with an antiseptic silver-green/blue color palette): people at her job are anonymous because all she can think about is her own inexplicable behavior and unflattering appearance. At her job, she smells passing travelers, sniffing for "shame, guilt, rage," or other heightened dark vibes. This technique is pretty helpful for a border patrolwoman: she uses her supernatural smelling abilities to ferret out a teenage smuggler, a child pornographer, etc. You might be wondering: what is this mysterious super-power? It's a mystery, for while, since Tina&nbsp;doesn't know where she comes from. That all changes when Vore—a mysterious traveler who confuses Tina's otherwise unerring nose—visits her at her job.</p><p>Vore is pretty unsettling, and not just because he looks like&nbsp;<a href=#>Phil Hartman</a> in his Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer get-up. Look at the way that Milonoff smiles at Tina: it's a knowing smile, one that reveals more about Vore's unabashed randiness than it does&nbsp;about his character's defensive prickliness. Vore is supposed to be Tina's counterpart because he's unapologetic about what makes him different. He knows that he's not human, and that makes him act out. Like when he jokes around with Tina by disguising a tin of grubs (which he uses to feed his ... well, I'd better not) as a home-made bomb, complete with a time-piece and stray red wires. I know that this isn't supposed to be an endearing character moment, but well, it's&nbsp;really&nbsp;not endearing.</p><p>Still: Vore's also supposed to be good for Tina, especially when compared with Tina's grubby significant other Roland (<a href=#>Jörgen Thorsson</a>), a cartoonishly manipulative dog trainer who loves his pooches&nbsp;more than he does Tina (Roland, in his&nbsp;first scene, to a scabies-infected dog:&nbsp;"Are you the star of this house? Good dog.").&nbsp;Roland's always mooching off of Tina: he doesn't contribute financially to their shared house and barely even pays attention to her when they're eating dinner together.&nbsp;By contrast, Vore and Tina are ostensibly SUPER-attracted to each other. Like when he shows her a Frankenstein-like scar over his right collar bone:&nbsp;"Lightning is no laughing matter. You can touch it, if you want."&nbsp;Or when they exchange wild, sloppy&nbsp;kisses right before having extremely awkward sex in the woods.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bpquclad6c3yQcQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carlie-jo-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much money is Carlie Jo worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paula-marcenaro-solinger.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paula Marcenaro Solinger movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
