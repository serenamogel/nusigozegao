The group is now composed of seven men and five women, or 41% female.</p><p>The group’s lack of banking expertise is likely to be a focus for investigators. Just one current member has had a career at the top of the investment banking world.&nbsp;</p><p>What is clear is that the bank, and much of the board, burnished their Democratic credentials as part of their strategy.</p><p>They donated to Obama, Clinton and President Biden, and to local Democratic congressional reps including Pelosi —&nbsp;as well as political action committees for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen.

In the same interview, she detailed how&nbsp;she saw her role as director as being about forcing companies to embrace diversity.</p><p>“It’s not enough to just report the numbers, instead, we need to demand a deep look at company culture — what are the informal networks and behaviors that support the status quo,” Burr said. “Discuss this at the board level and hold management teams accountable for real change.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Winemaker who toasts neighbor Nancy&nbsp;Pelosi</h2><p>Garen K.
