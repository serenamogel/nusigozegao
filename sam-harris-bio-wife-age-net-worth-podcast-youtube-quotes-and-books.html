He was born on April 9, 1967, in Los Angeles, California, USA. Harris has worked on an array of topics ranging from artificial intelligence, ethics, rationality, free will, neuroscience, meditation, philosophy, politics, Islam, and terrorism.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-podcast-making-sense></span><span>Sam Harris Podcast | Making Sense</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In his making sense podcast, Harris discusses absolutely everything and anything. His topics range from religion, politics, race, health, philosophy, current issues, environmental and many others. He also hosts professionals from different fields of expertise according to his topic of the day. Among his guests was the retired Russian chess grandmaster, former world chess champion, writer, and political activist,<strong> Gary Kasparov</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-waking-up-a-guide-to-spirituality-without-religion></span><span>Sam Harris Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion.</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris is mindful and skeptic in this book and offers a contemporary addition to this lineage of human inquiry. It is an unprecedented and bold masterwork of such integration between science and spirituality that Harris himself describes as “by turns a seeker’s memoir, associate degree introduction to the brain, a manual of contemplative instruction, and a philosophical unraveling of what most of the people concede to be the middle of their inner lives.” Or (perhaps most ably) a trial “to pluck the diamond from the dunghill of esoteric religion.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-spirituality-without-religion></span><span>Sam Harris Spirituality Without Religion</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris rejects the chasm between religious spirituality on the one hand and scientific rationality on the other and seeks to define a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion. He argues that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like neuroscience and psychology.</p><p>Sam Harris contends that science can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience. His comprehension of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-politics-on-trump></span><span>Sam Harris Politics | On Trump</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Honestly, thus far, that [the casualty of truth] is the most harmful aspect of his presidency. Just the complete ruination of any standard of honesty in political discourse and it’s astonishing to me. I have not yet accepted that this is even possible, much less actual. I don’t think I’m alone, but I’m continually having the bewildering experience that I just cannot believe that this person is president.”</p><p>“It is all focused on this particular aspect of his presidency, where he lies more than any person has ever lied in human history and not only does he get away with it, his supporters seem to delight in his running roughshod over any expectation that a public figure would be honest. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature for them and that’s really disturbing.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-atheist-sam-harris-on-atheism></span><span>Sam Harris Atheist | Sam Harris On Atheism</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris, alongside Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett,&nbsp; are described as the atheistic “Four Horsemen of the Non-Apocalypse”, but he rejects the term ‘atheist’. He said, “while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never thought of myself as an atheist before being inducted to speak as one… I think that ‘atheist’ is a term that we do not need, in the same way, that we don’t need a word for someone who rejects astrology.”</p><p>During a podcast discussion with Neil de Grasse Tyson, Harris said, “If astrology ever became ascendant, then we would talk about reason, common sense, and science to neutralize those claims without ever defining ourselves in opposition to astrology. In my first book (‘The End of Faith’), which inducted me into the small club of the ‘new atheists’ I never even used the term ‘atheist’ or ‘atheism’ – and it’s not that I withheld use of that term – it simply never occurred to me to use the term.</p><p>…I was just talking about the problems of religion, the opposition between reason and faith, and science and untestable/unverifiable claims. [Atheism] may have its moment historically, it may be necessary to shine a light on the fact that you have by and large the smartest and most educated people in society politically anathematized and marginalized. I don’t do anything to dodge the term because I fit the description but it’s a weak term.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-age></span><span>Sam Harris Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris was born on 9 April 1967 in Los Angeles, California, <strong>USA</strong>. In 2009, he received a Ph.D. degree in cognitive neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles. Harris is 52 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-family></span><span>Sam Harris Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris’ mother is TV producer Susan Harris, a secular Jew, and his father is actor Berkeley Harris who belongs to a Quaker background. He was raised by his mother after his parents divorced when he was two. He once stated that his upbringing was completely secular and that his parents hardly discussed religion.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-married-wife-children></span><span>Sam Harris Married | Wife | Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2004, Harris got married to editor Annaka Harris. Just like her husband, Annaka Harris is also a writer but one for children’s books. Other than that, she has very little of her background known to the public. Harris and his wife have two daughters, Emma and Violet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-vegan></span><span>Sam Harris Vegan</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris was at one point a vegetarian, but gave it up after six years, citing health concerns. He returned to vegetarianism for ethical reasons in 2015 with the intention of eventually going vegan. He also supported the idea of cultured meat. In early 2018, he stopped being a vegetarian once again.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-net-worth></span><span>Sam Harris Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris is an American author, neuroscientist, and philosopher who was born in Los Angeles, California in April 1967. He is the co-founder of the non-profit organization Project Reason. Harris has a net worth of $2 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-free-will></span><span>Sam Harris Free Will</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris says the concept of free will cannot be delineated on to any conceivable reality and is incoherent. He states that neuroscience reveals humans to be biochemical puppets. That our thoughts and intentions emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control. He adds, “Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-morality></span><span>Sam Harris Morality</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In his book <strong>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</strong> (2010), Sam Harris promotes a science of morality and argues that many thinkers have long confused the relationship between morality, facts, and science. He aims to sculpt a third path between secularists who say morality is subjective/relative, and those of religion who say that morality is given by God and the bible.</p><p>Harris argues that the only worthwhile moral framework is one where “morally good” things pertaining to increasing the “well-being of conscious creatures”. He further states that ‘moral questions’ will have objectively right and wrong answers which are grounded in empirical facts about what causes people to flourish. Thus, “science can determine human values.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-abortion-sam-harris-on-abortion></span><span>Sam Harris Abortion | Sam Harris On Abortion</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“A three-day-old human embryo is a collection of 150 cells called a blastocyst. There are, for the sake of comparison, more than 100,000 cells in the brain of a fly. The human embryos that are destroyed in stem-cell research do not have brains or even neurons. Consequently, there is no reason to believe they can suffer their destruction in any way at all.</p><p>It is worth remembering, in this context, that when a person’s brain has died, we currently deem it acceptable to harvest his organs (provided he has donated them for this purpose) and bury him in the ground. If it is acceptable to treat a person whose brain has died as something less than a human being, it should be acceptable to treat a blastocyst as such. If you are concerned about suffering in this universe, killing a fly should present you with greater moral difficulties than killing a human blastocyst.</p><p>“It has been estimated that 50 percent of all human conceptions end in spontaneous abortion, usually without a woman even realizing that she was pregnant. In fact, 20 percent of all recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage. There is an obvious truth here that cries out for acknowledgment: if God exists, He is the most prolific abortionist of all.”</p><p>―<strong> Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian Nation</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-harris-books></span><span>Sam Harris Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason.
