The trio’s zany antics in apartment 201—with Somers as Chrissy Snow, Ritter as Jack Tripper, and DeWitt as Janet Wood—helped the show became a mainstay of the Nielsen Top 10 ratings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1980, Somers—who died on October 15, 2023, at age 76—had graced the cover of numerous magazines and was seemingly at the top of her game. More importantly, she knew her worth to the show. When it came time for contract negotiations, she set a reasonable threshold: the equivalent of her male costars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">What she didn’t expect was to walk out jobless. “The show’s response was, ‘Who do you think you are?’” the actor told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/suzanne-somers-recalls-being-fired-from-threes-company-for-asking-for-equal-pay data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>. “They said, ‘John Ritter is the star.’” But Somers’ unexpected exit from Three’s Company helped her redefine her celebrated career.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The men were making five times as much as the women</h2><img alt="joyce dewitt, john ritter, and suzanne somers pose for a photo together in front of a purple background" title="Joyce DeWitt, John Ritter, and Suzanne Somers in a 1979 promotional photo for 'Three's Company'" width=2021 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-93375204.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Joyce DeWitt, John Ritter, and Suzanne Somers starred in Three’s Company.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Somers first signed on to the show, she agreed to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.yahoo.com/now/shes-greedy-suzanne-somers-remembers-asking-equal-pay-threes-company-resulted-smear-campaign-150058529.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$3,500 per week salary" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">$3,500 per week salary</a> to play the bubbly Chrissy. As the show gained traction, her salary climbed, and soon, she was making $30,000 a week. “I had the highest demographic of all women in television 18 to 49,” she said in an interview for the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/suzanne-somers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Academy of Television Arts and Sciences" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a> in 2009.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With a better understanding of the industry than when she started, she went into her contract negotiation for the fifth season with equal pay in mind. “I’m looking around and thinking, ‘Why are all the men... making 10 times more?” she questioned. Her costars, Ritter and DeWitt, already had their contracts set, so she gave them a heads up that she was going to go in strong.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I say to John and Joyce… I’m going to ask for big money and a piece of the back end and if you two back me up... we’ll all get it, so I’ll be the patsy,” she continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her husband, former television producer Alan Hamel, went to negotiate for her, asking for $150,000 a week, which was the average that men were earning on television at the time and on par with what her costar Ritter was making. (She said she didn’t know at the time Ritter was making more since the three of them had a favored-nations clause.)<br></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Another show’s negotiations affected the outcome</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before heading to the meeting that morning, Hamel checked with Somers again, hypothesizing that it could all “blow out of the water.” “I said, ‘They’re not going to get rid of Chrissy,’” she recalled in the Academy interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">What Somers and Hamel didn’t know at the time was that the ABC executives were holding onto their pursestrings extra tight because they had just settled a deal with the stars of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/laverne-and-shirley-facts-anniversary data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Laverne & Shirley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Laverne & Shirley</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/penny-marshall data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Penny Marshall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Penny Marshall</a> and Cindy Williams, and were paying the two women more than they had hoped.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Biographies of Other Sitcom Legends</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Laverne & Shirley had just negotiated a monster deal, and afterwards, they decided they needed to make an example of female actresses so that no other woman would ask to be paid what men were making,” Hamel told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/suzanne-somers-recalls-being-fired-from-threes-company-for-asking-for-equal-pay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a time before cell phones, Somers waited at home anxiously. “So I hear the front door open, and I can tell by the way the door closes and the sound of his feet walking up the stairs that this is not good,” she recalled. That’s when he told her that she had been fired.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Never think that you are not replaceable—rule number one,” Somers said.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">After she was fired, Somers was escorted by a police guard on set</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As if that sudden blow wasn’t hard enough, they hadn’t finished filming the fifth season yet, so she had to go back to set. But it wasn’t business as usual.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“So what they did do was force me to finish out the year but diminish me to a minute,” Somers explained in the Academy interview. “They built this little side set—it was crazy what they did. They would have a police guard come meet me at the back door, walk me in. I was not allowed to see anybody from the original show, only the wardrobe guy, who would bring me a pair of shorts and something.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the sparse set was a chair, phone and lamp—with one camera filming her saying lines on the phone. “It just felt so like I was being punished like I was a bad girl. It brought up all my old feelings of low self-worth,” Somers remembered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The demeaning treatment came all because she asked to be paid the same as the men. “It was just a terrible time,” she said.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The industry shunned her, so she reinvented herself</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Off the set, life wasn’t any better. She went from being the most coveted actress in the demographic to not even being able to get an interview with any press outlet. “I sat home for the better part of the year, thinking, ‘Why did I do it? Here I had the world by the tail… why did I think that I should be paid what they’re paying the men?’” Somers said in the Academy interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But one day, everything clicked. “I hear voices sometimes, not in a weird way,” she explained. “I hear a voice in my head, like a loudspeaker. It says, ‘Why are you focused on what you don’t have? Why don’t you focus on what it is you do have?’” And that’s when she realized the gift Three’s Company had given her that it couldn’t take away: visibility.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Using her name and face recognition, she plotted not a comeback, but a reinvention. “Everybody in this country knows my name—I have visibility,” she said of the realization. “That’s something.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon she was starring in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2006/nov/09/suzanne-somers-finds-balance-in-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Las Vegas production" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Las Vegas production</a> with 13 dancers and a 27-piece orchestra, performing a lively revue with classic stage songs like “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.” And in 1987, she was named Las Vegas Entertainer of the Year along with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/frank-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Sinatra</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Somers became a successful entrepreneur, most famously serving as the spokesperson for the ThighMaster exercise machine in the 1990s.

She was also a fitness and beauty line owner, author, and talk show host.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She even made a triumphant return to the small screen. Starting in 1991, Somers played Carol Foster-Lambert on the popular sitcom Step by Step alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/patrick-duffy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Patrick Duffy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Patrick Duffy</a> for seven seasons. She also served as a co-host for the comedy show Candid Camera and stepped into the ballroom in 2015 on the ABC reality competition Dancing with the Stars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">All of this success stemmed from her decision to ask for equal pay. “That was the great thing about being fired,” Somers told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/suzanne-somers-recalls-being-fired-from-threes-company-for-asking-for-equal-pay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a> in 2020. “I would have never been able to do what I do now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Somers relied on her resilience in other ways, too.
