But “could have been worse” doesn’t mean “wasn’t terrible,” and Park’s year got off to a particularly rough start.</p><h2 id=h-asley-park-s-recent-health-scare-and-why-she-was-in-the-hospital-explained data-injectable=false>Asley Park’s recent health scare and why she was in the hospital, explained</h2><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>According to Park’s post, a holiday trip abroad took a bad turn when she came down with a case of tonsillitis overseas. Tonsillitis shouldn’t generally be a big deal – people have been performing tonsillectomies for centuries, and they’re generally considered to be one of those surgeries that doctors can perform hungover without their glasses on.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, medical science is still a science, and science is still a giant pain. Park’s surgery wound up being one of the rare ones that goes terribly wrong, and the 31-year-old actress ended up suffering from septic shock.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Park (@ashleyparklady)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Septic shock is a complicated, unenviable condition, and one that needs to be taken seriously and treated immediately once spotted. It starts as sepsis, in which the body’s immune system decides to attack its own tissue in response to an infection. Its symptoms are eerily tough to predict, and include everything from shivering and breathing too quickly to just kind of feeling weird.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=927 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s</a> fun, easy-to-digest synopsis on the subject, sepsis reaches its final form by progressing into septic shock, in which the body’s blood pressure drops dramatically, affecting the organs. It’s a dangerously bad time, with levels of seriousness ranging from “bad” to “really, really bad.” The NIH claims that patients with abdominal sepsis experience mortality rates of around 70%. Without knowing the details of Park’s case, it’s impossible to know what caused her to go through all of this.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>For Park’s part, she seems to have gotten through the worst of her ordeal in strong if somber spirits. In the social media post announcing what she’d been through, she thanked her team of medical professionals, as well as her partner, fellow Emily in Paris actor Paul Forman, who she praised for having been “unconditionally” by her side over the holidays.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=false>This wasn’t Park’s first brush with a serious medical condition. At 15, she was diagnosed with leukemia before being treated with chemotherapy. It’s unclear whether Park’s condition will have any effect on the shooting schedule for her currently only confirmed future project, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth season of Emily in Paris</a>. Still, her Instagram post seems hopeful. “I’m healing and I promise I’m gonna be okay,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZp2dnrm6ecinZKmZop7Abq3NnWSbnZWberTAwKtkmquYobK6ec%2BaqaRlkaOxbsPHsmSwmaNiwKmxjKGmrKiZqa6ttdmem2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-brown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Brown Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-christina-after-married-at-first-sight.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Christina After Married At First Sight?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
