Masterson and Phillips have been married since 2011, and, while the rapes occurred long before the pair even met, Phillips is inextricably linked to her longtime husband as he heads to his next hearing in August.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Phillips is in no way at fault for Masterson’s actions, but his conviction is bringing her name — and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her own past misdeeds</a> — back into conversations. Phillips already has a negative reputation attached to her, thanks to Mean Girls actor Daniel Franzese’s courage in speaking out about her bullying and homophobia on the set of his very first film. Ironically, Phillips proved herself to be a perfect fit for 2001’s Bully, after she displayed abhorrent behavior on its set, aimed toward Franzese.</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>Franzese accused Phillips of homophobia, body shaming, and even physical assault on the set of the 2001 film, and the actress later apologized, but the reputation has followed her for years. She certainly didn’t help things by defending two accused rapists — her father and husband — after claims of sexual abuse arose. She even went so far as to mock one of Masterson’s accusers, Chrissie Carnell-Bixler, on Instagram, cementing herself as a lifelong bully in the eyes of most people.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>With her husband’s conviction fresh on people’s minds, many former fans are wondering what Phillips’ and Masterson’s financial situation is. They’re likely to see a major dip in income, given the results of the trial, but for now, the pair is still doing just fine.</p><h2 id=h-bijou-phillips-net-worth data-injectable=false>Bijou Phillips’ net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bijou_Phillips_Danny_Masterson.jpg><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Despite her lack of work in recent years, Phillips was a household name back in the early 2000s. She appeared in a slew of popular releases, including Almost Famous, the aforementioned Bully, and Havoc between 2000 and 2005, and continued to find work up until 2013 — coincidentally, just a few years after Franzese’s accusations came to light.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=false>Those early appearances, paired with Masterson’s work on That ’70s Show and Men at Work, gave the Masterson/Phillips family a cozy financial cushion. Combined, they’re currently worth $8 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, which — while low compared to some of their peers — could see them through their impending legal struggles with some to spare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZKet7DBjKmfoqScnr20ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arm-cortex-a73-artemis-unveiled.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The ARM Cortex A73 - Artemis Unveiled</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
