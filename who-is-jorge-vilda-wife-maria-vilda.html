Jorge has certainly been very popular as a football coach, notably leading the Spanish Female team to the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup after beating England in the final. The incidents from that tournament overshadowed the tile win, and the coach has now left his role, leading to a lot of conversation about him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spain-sack-jorge-vilda><strong>Spain Sack Jorge Vilda</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Jorge Vilda’s wife, Maria Vilda, and her children will be the biggest losers here as their husband and father is no longer employed with the Spanish Female team.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As a result of Luis Rubiales’ actions, Spain’s Women’s World Cup-winning coach Jorge Vilda was fired by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Tuesday.</p><p>The committee of regional presidents overseeing the RFEF, headed by Pedro Rocha, informed Vilda of their intention to remove <strong><a href=#>Rubiales after FIFA suspended him</a></strong> as president of the Spanish FA for 90 days for his unwanted kiss on forward Jenni Hermoso.</p><p>On Tuesday, shortly after the RFEF released a statement apologizing for Rubiales’ “totally unacceptable behavior” and stating that it was supporting disciplinary proceedings against him, Vilda was informed of the decision.</p><p>The RFEF announced Montse Tomé as his replacement later on Tuesday. She has been Vilda’s assistant coach since 2018, becoming the first woman to ever coach the Spain women’s team.</p><p>“The RFEF wants to convey to the whole of society and to the whole of world football its deepest regret for what has happened, which has tarnished our national team, our football, and our society,” the statement reads. “The damage caused to Spanish football, to Spanish sport, to Spanish society, and to the values of football and sport as a whole has been enormous.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The dismissal was hinted at last week by Joan Soteras, the president of the Catalan Football Federation and a representative on the RFEF council of regional presidents.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>“There have to be structural changes in women’s football,” he said. “One of those could be [removing] Vilda. He was at the centre of the mess with the national team [last September]. If it was up to me, I would [dismiss him]. A change would be the most convenient thing for the good of women’s football.”</p><p>Vilda, 42, had been in command since 2015 and was in control when Spain won the World Cup by defeating England 1-0 in the championship match in Sydney. Despite never having previously prevailed in a knockout game at a major tournament.</p><p>How would this affect Jorge Vilda’s wife, Maria Vilda, and their children? As the head coach of the Spain women’s national football team, Jorge Vilda has become a well-known name in Spanish football coaching. His marriage to Maria Vilda has been under scrutiny as a result of a recent incident involving charges of inappropriate behavior, in addition to his coaching job.</p><p>After finishing his playing career, Jorge Vilda started coaching, and his career has been filled with both triumphs and conflicts. He held coaching jobs with Spain’s youth teams and had great success, winning gold at both the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup and the UEFA Women’s U-17 EURO. He succeeded Ignacio Quereda as the head coach of the Spain women’s senior national football team in 2015.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-maria-vilda-jorge-vilda-wife><strong>Who Is Maria Vilda, Jorge Vilda Wife?</strong></h2><p>Maria Vilda is Jorge Vilda’s wife, but not much information is available about her. Unlike her husband, she has been able to avoid the spotlight. Jorge Vilda’s work life is well known, but little is known about his private life. It is well known that he is married to Maria Vilda, with whom he has two children. The specifics of their relationship and her life are still unknown.</p><p>Maria Vilda’s decision to maintain a low profile in the middle of the scandals involving Jorge Vilda’s coaching career, notably the most recent one, has prompted inquiries regarding her viewpoint on the subject. Her prudence and secrecy highlight how crucial it is to respect people’s private lives.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdn7yzs8RmraKklJZ6uLXFnmSmmaKerm7CyKWbmmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-gram-tica.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bill Gramtica</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./svetlana-kamynina.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Svetlana Kamynina</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
