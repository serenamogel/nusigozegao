The platform shoes were so high you could break your ankle just trying to walk out the door, shag carpeting was a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>must-have in every hip home</a>, and no one batted an eye when you told them you'd seen <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Star Wars</a> a dozen times in the theater. Of course, not everything about <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>the '70s</a> is worth reliving, and some of the era's trends were downright ridiculous—especially the slang. From discussing how "far out" your friends' fashion choices were to talking like a trucker, these are the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>'70s slang terms</a> that are impossible to forget And for more nostalgia from this groovy era, check out these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>50 Things Only People Who Lived in the 1970s Will Remember</a>.</p><p>Read the original article on<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#> Best Life</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/iStock-1054011512.jpg><p>The "chill pill" mentioned here isn't something you could pick up at a pharmacy—it's entirely figurative. And, more importantly, it means your stress is affecting others and you need to seriously calm down.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "Hey, you seem totally stressed. Take a chill pill, dude."</p><p>And if you were truly hip back in the day, you owned these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>25 Things Cool People Wore in the 1970s</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/women-whispering-pointing.jpg><p>When you want the whole truth and nothing but the truth, you ask for the skinny. Because, well, apparently the truth had a high metabolism in the '70s.</p><p><i>Example: </i>"Yes I want to know who she was with last night. Give me the skinny!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/shutterstock_248727865.jpg><p>The other side of today is tomorrow, so to catch you on the flip side means to see you again tomorrow. Yeah, we know, this '70s slang doesn't make much sense to us, either. And for more great out-dated slang, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>terms from the 1950s that seem hilariously dated now.&nbsp;</a></p><p><i>Example:</i> "I got to run, but I'll catch you on the flip side."</p><p>And if you grew up in this far out decade, you'll remember these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>20 Things Every "Cool Kid" Growing Up in the 1970s Owned</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/people-dancing.jpg><p>To dance, but to do so in an especially enthusiastic way. Ideally, while being accompanied by disco music.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "That ABBA song makes me want to boogie down."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_400477972.jpg><p>When something is presented, and then quietly taken away. A taunting word for a jovial denial.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "Oh, you want a piece of gum? Sure, here you go. (pulls it away.) Psych!"</p><p>And for more dated slang to ditch, nix these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>100 Slang Terms From the 20th Century No One Uses Anymore</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/man-flirting.jpg><p>If you find a woman's body especially attractive, you might say she was built like a brick house. As in: Well put together, proportionally perfect.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "That girl is so fine, she's a brick house."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_756256879.jpg><p>When somebody is up in your business and they won't leave you alone, just tell them to stop dipping in your Kool-Aid. Your Kool-Aid, in this equation, is your business, and the dipper is the person who won't leave you alone.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "I told you I don't want to talk about my divorce. Stop dipping in my Kool-Aid."</p><p>And for more retro fun, check out these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>20 Things All '70s Kids Remember</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/shutterstock_1142917289.jpg><p>If someone is acting unusual or wacky, you could accuse them of being a fry. Were French fries especially kooky during the '70s? It appears so.</p><p><i>Example: </i>"Did you hear that Steve went streaking last weekend? What a fry!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/police-cars-at-night.jpg><p>An authority figure. It could mean the police, the government, or even your parents. Anyone with the power to take your fun away.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "I wish I was doing better, but the Man is keeping me down."</p><p>And for more great nostalgia delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Business-Partners-3.jpg><p>A solid is a favor because, um… favors weren't liquid in the '70s? When you do someone a solid, you're helping them out in a big way.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "Would you do me a solid and give me a ride to the airport?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/upset-man-girlfriend-on-bed.jpg><p>You want to call something bogus, but you don't have time or energy to pronounce the "gus" part. It's like Millennial speak, but with more chest hair.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "He blew you off again? That's bogue."</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_505088542.jpg alt="70s slang no one uses" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This '70s slang was meant as an insult to disco dancers. Calling them Stella means you think they're arrogant and full of themselves. Unless their name really <i>is</i> Stella, then your insult is just a friendly hello.</p><p>Example: "Naw, don't invite her to the party. She's a total Stella."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_505088542.jpg><p>Despite what it might seem, this popular '70s phrase doesn't tell you where something is located—it tells you how cool it is.</p><p><i>Example: </i>"Did you see her new mood ring? That chick is far out!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/woman-giving-peace-sign.jpg><p>Why say something boring like "goodbye" when leaving the room when you could drop this sweet slang instead?</p><p><i>Example: </i>"I'm feeling tired, so I'm going to head out. Later days, dudes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/friends-wave-masks.jpg><p>When something is taken to the extreme, and it couldn't possibly be more wild or crazy, you have reached the maximum level of awesomeness.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><i>Example: </i>"We're gonna have some fun tonight to the <i>max</i>!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/multicultural-coworkers-excited-achievement.jpg><p>When you're talking to somebody on a CB radio and you want them to know you've heard what they just said. During the '70s, an actual CB radio was not required to use this slang. It wasn't just truckers who wanted to talk like truckers.</p><p>Example: "10-4, good buddy. I hear you loud and clear."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_551841907.jpg><p>This insult from Fonzie on <i>Happy Days</i> pretended the slang's origins were in the '50s. But actually, "sit on it"—a nicer way of saying "shut up"—didn't catch on until the '70s.</p><p><i>Example</i>: "I've had about enough from you. Sit on it!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/fonzie-happy-days.jpg><p>If someone isn't all there, and their attention span is the equivalent of somebody floating through space, staring at nothing in particular, then they definitely qualify as a space cadet.</p><p><i>Example:</i> "Take a look at that space cadet. She's in her own little world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_464538905.jpg><p>Again, not a slang term to be taken literally. There's no eating involved. Instead, it connotes confusion. Whatever they're trying to understand makes no sense to them. They must've been out to lunch when it was explained.</p><p><i>Example: </i>"I have no idea what any of that means. I'm out to lunch."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/two-men-in-conversation.jpg><p>You're not ordering a side dish at a barbecue place. Rather, it's expression of approval.</p><p><i>Example: </i>"Sure, I'd love to see a movie tonight. That'd be cool beans."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmanFnZcBuv8uapaBlpJq%2Frr%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andynsane-net-worth-286934.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andynsane Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taskmaster-nz-comedian-bubbah-unveils-arm-tattoo-of-her-castmates-faces-on-air.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taskmaster NZ: Comedian Bubbah unveils arm tattoo of her castmates faces on air</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
