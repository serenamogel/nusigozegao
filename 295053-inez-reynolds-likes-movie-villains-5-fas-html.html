In May 2019, during an appearance on "Live with Kelly and Ryan," the "Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu" actor talked about his daughters and revealed that Inez is a fan of villains. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She's super into villains. We watch Beauty and the Beast, and her favorite character is Gaston."</p><p class=dh>The doting dad also mentioned how the 5-year-old's doctor caught on to her pull to the "dark side." When their pediatrician met Inez, she said the little one was "shady." Reynolds agreed and recounted one day at the airport on their way home when a funny situation unfolded. Inez, only two years old at the time, got selected for a secondary security pat down, and she took it in stride as Ryan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">joked</a>, "She just takes it like a hard-earned felon."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inez Has a Sense of Style</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In mid-2021, Inez's mother shared a photo of her dressed in a pink and white outfit.

Blake captioned the post by saying she was trying to get her 4-year-old dressed at 5 a.m., but she insisted on dressing her instead. It seems <a class="me a" href=#>Blake Lively</a>'s daughter has a sense of style, and the "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" actress is enjoying all the fun and memorable moments with her little one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmhlaHqqusSzZKudqaO8rbDSZqOio5Woeq671aKcZq6Zobmitc2sZG5llpbAb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ken-purcell-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ken Purcell Coaching History, Wikipedia, Biography, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unveiling-the-mysterious-death-of-angela-razook-wright-get-the-full-story-behind-her-viral-video-demise.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Unveiling the Mysterious Death of Angela Razook Wright: Get the Full Story Behind Her Viral Video De</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
