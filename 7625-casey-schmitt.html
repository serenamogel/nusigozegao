He&#39s had no such problem in 2022, when he&#39s been one of the most consistent performers in the High-A Eugene lineup. He&#39s made plenty of contact, produced both average and power and played outstanding defense at third base. Further, when Marco Luciano hit the injured list with a balky back, Schmitt stepped in as the everyday shortstop. The move speaks to not only the amount of trust the Giants have, but also the makeup required to undertake such a move for his team.</p><p><strong>Track Record:</strong> Schmitt made a name for himself both at San Diego State and in the Cape Cod League, where he starred as both a pitcher and a hitter. He finished his stint on the Cape by closing the game and hitting two home runs to help win the championship for Cotuit, where he was teammates with future Giants system-mate Nick Swiney. Schmitt showed well in his final season at SDSU before the pandemic cut things short, and the Giants selected him with the 47th pick. His pro debut started slowly at Low-A, but he put together a pair of solid months in the middle of the season.</p><p><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> Exemplary defensive work is the hallmark of Schmitt&#39s game. He&#39s a natural third baseman with quick reflexes and the strong arm to stick at the position in the long-term, though some question whether his hands might need a little work. Schmitt got off to a much rockier start at the plate than one would expect for a player with a college pedigree making his debut at Low-A. He often looked like he was pressing, and as a result would let his hips fly open and stride too far while selling out for power. That left him with holes on the outside part of the plate and against breaking balls from righthanders. When he stayed within himself, he had more success.</p><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Schmitt will move in 2022 to High-A Eugene, where he&#39ll get tested by advanced pitching. If he shows the same form as he did in the middle of his first season, he has the ceiling of an everyday third baseman who plays outstanding defense.</p><p><strong>Scouting Grades:</strong> Hit: 45. Power: 55. Run: 45. Fielding: 60. Arm: 70.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2yDc4GMnJisnaliwKS0zKKrrWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chet-powers-net-worth-262787.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chet Powers Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-spade.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Spade</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
