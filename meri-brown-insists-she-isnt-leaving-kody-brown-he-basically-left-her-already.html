Meri speculated that Robyn would assume she was leaving the family like Christine, although Meri claimed that wasn’t the case.</p><p>In fact, Meri planned on telling Robyn about the move before she even told Kody since Robyn would actually care. Kody, on the other hand, “wouldn’t give a flying rat’s a**,” according to Meri.</p><p>Robyn has begged Meri, “Please don’t leave me to do this alone,” but as Meri noted, she and Kody don’t have a relationship. But that’s when Meri began singing the same old song, claiming she was staying put in her marriage and Flagstaff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meri-claims-she-s-not-leaving-kody-or-the-family-but-says-he-s-already-left-her>Meri claims she’s not leaving Kody or the family but says he’s ‘already’ left her</h2><p>“I’m not leaving. I’m not leaving the family. I’m not leaving Kody,” Meri confessed while driving. “Kody has basically left me already.”</p><p>Janelle chimed in, adding that things were very broken in Kody and Meri’s marriage, or what was left of it anyway. As we all watched Meri do for years, Janelle believed that Kody’s first wife was holding onto hope that something would “happen.”</p><p>But as Janelle also shared, Kody “doesn’t speak really kindly” to Meri, nor does he watch out for her.</p><p>For his part, Kody confessed that unlike Christine — who up and left him when she discovered how unhappy she was — Meri has taken the time to think about whether their marriage was salvageable. But Meri was still waiting to have a conversation with Kody about trying to save their marriage, which hadn’t happened up until that point.</p><p>When Christine chimed in, she accused Kody of stringing Meri along for years, calling his treatment of Meri “mean and cruel.”</p><p>“I saw that he would have done the same thing to me if I would have stayed,” Christine admitted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meri-continues-to-leave-sister-wives-fans-hanging-regarding-her-side-of-the-story>Meri continues to leave Sister Wives fans hanging regarding her side of the story</h2><p>Meri and Kody issued a joint statement announcing the permanent termination of their marriage. In the announcement’s caption on Instagram, Meri hinted at some juicy gossip that we aren’t aware of.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“There is so much more to be told about this story, and I assure you, my truth will be told,” Meri wrote.</p><p>For months now, Meri has teased her fans for months about there being “<a href=#>so much more</a>” to her story, and Sister Wives fans are eager to know what she’s been keeping from us. Perhaps we’ll find out this season on Sister Wives, but until then, we’re left with nothing but <a href=#>Meri’s cryptic messages</a> about what went on behind the scenes.</p><p>Sister Wives airs on Sundays at 10/9c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ52av6p5waumsKZdnru0tdKtqmarmJp6qr%2FNrWSlnZGrtq%2BzjKSmnbFdl7%2Bww81mn55lkpbAqq%2FApaOyZZyas7V5x56pZpmcp7KisNho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-one-piece-is-real-twitter-meme-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The One Piece is real Twitter meme, explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arm-cortex-a78-cortex-x1-cpu-ip-diverging.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Performance &amp;amp; Power Projections: Best of Both Worlds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
