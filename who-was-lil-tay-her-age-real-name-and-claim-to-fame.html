But while many are aware that Tay was way more famous for someone who was that young, the simplest facts about her life might be a question mark for some.</p><h2 id=h-what-was-lil-tay-s-real-name-and-her-age data-injectable=false>What was Lil Tay’s real name and her age?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lil Tay (@liltay)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>While the ones familiar with her videos better know her as “Lil Tay,” her social media moniker, the young star’s real name is claimed by many to be Claire Hope. Her age remains largely unconfirmed — as she shot to fame in 2017-18 thanks to her videos on Instagram and YouTube, she should have been around 13 or older. But based on the many reports of her untimely demise, the viral internet celebrity was 14 at the time of her passing, which means she didn’t meet the required age limit for most of the social media platforms when her accounts were created.</p><h2 id=h-why-was-lil-tay-famous data-injectable=false>Why was Lil Tay famous?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/wv8JP-oMVsc</figure><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>If we go by her plausible age mentioned in news reports — as well as her own admission — Tay was nine when she shot to fame in 2018 after posting videos to Instagram and on her YouTube channel wherein she was seen bragging and swearing about possessing immense wealth, being the owner of luxury sports cars, and how her toilet, for instance, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worth more than your momma’s rent</a>, while also being decked in Louis Vitton belts and almost always flaunting a stack of cash.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>As per Tay, she became “the youngest flexer of the century” and soon earned – in less than a year – over two million followers on Instagram. According to Tay, she used to live in poverty but worked really hard to earn her wealth. She even joined Harvard but soon dropped out.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>So, did the then 9-year-old manage her own Instagram handle, a platform that needs its users to be 13 and above to create their profiles? As per a 2019 article by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cut</a>, it was Jason Tian (16 at the time), her half-brother, who created and handled her profile. Currently, it can’t be said with certainty whether the brother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned in the statement on her account</a>, regarding Tay’s passing, is Jason.</p><p>“We have no words to express the unbearable loss and indescribable pain. This outcome was entirely unexpected, and has left us all in shock. Her brother’s passing adds an even more unimaginable depth to our grief.”</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=false>Though Tay’s videos often mentioned a rags-to-riches life story for her videos, she was the youngest child of Angela Tian (a real-estate broker) and Christopher J.
