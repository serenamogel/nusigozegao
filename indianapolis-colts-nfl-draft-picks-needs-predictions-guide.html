After another failed replacement attempt with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matt Ryan</a>, who was released following one turnover-filled season, Indianapolis is poised to select a signal caller with the No. 4 pick in the draft. The team has addressed other needs through free agency, most notably with the high-priced signing of former Pro Bowl kicker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matt Gay</a>, but this offseason will be defined by whom the Colts choose as their next franchise QB.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>'This kid's pretty special': Why Billy Napier believes Anthony Richardson can make it</p></a><h2>Colts’ key position needs</h2><p><strong>Offensive line:</strong> Indianapolis had the highest-paid offensive line in the league last season, though general manager Chris Ballard conceded it never looked the part. The Colts gave up 60 sacks, the second most in the NFL, due to the regression of center <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ryan Kelly</a>, left guard <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Quenton Nelson</a> and right tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Braden Smith</a>, all of whom received big contract extensions in recent years. Indianapolis also relied too much on unproven players at left tackle and right guard, which backfired tremendously. The team has yet to make an offensive line move in free agency, but the clock is ticking on strengthening that unit for presumably a rookie quarterback.</p><p><strong>Cornerback:</strong> After <a href=# rel=noopener>trading Stephon Gilmore</a> to the Cowboys and having Brandon Facyson sign with the Raiders in free agency, the Colts only have two cornerbacks on their roster who received significant playing time last season: <a href=#>Kenny Moore II</a> and <a href=#>Isaiah Rodgers Sr.</a> Moore struggled in defensive coordinator Gus Bradley’s new system, raising questions about whether he’ll be traded or cut before the 2023 season. Rodgers showed flashes of his potential but has never been a full-time starter. This puts Indianapolis firmly in the market for cornerbacks, through the draft and free agency, who can contribute right away on the back end.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/26134318/USATSI_19332997-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1706 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Kenny Moore II remains with the Colts after struggling during the 2022 season.

Indianapolis replaced him with former <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bills</a> wideout <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Isaiah McKenzie</a>, but that’s not enough. Adding another receiver, perhaps early in the draft, could go a long way as the franchise enters a new era.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Keefer: There's no quick fix for the Colts, and they've finally figured that out</p></a><h2>Colts draft analysis</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Would the Colts use their second draft pick on Hendon Hooker?

(Kevin Jairaj / USA Today)</span><p>2021: <strong>DE <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kwity Paye</a>,</strong> pick No. 21 — Paye took a step forward in his second season, totaling career highs of 45 tackles, 10 tackles for loss and six sacks. The 24-year-old missed five games due to an ankle injury, limiting his chance to continue developing. If he can stay healthy this year, he’ll have a real shot to blossom into one of the Colts’ top defensive players.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>2020: <strong>WR Michael Pittman Jr., </strong>pick No. 34 — Pittman has had five different starting quarterbacks in three seasons, making it harder to gauge his production or lack thereof. The 25-year-old isn’t the fastest wideout and doesn’t create much separation. However, he’s made a lot of contested catches and isn’t afraid of contact. Pittman’s registered 227 receptions for 2,510 yards and 11 scores in three years, proving he can at least be an NFL team’s No. 2 receiver.</p><p>2019: <strong>CB <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rock Ya-Sin</a>, </strong>pick No. 34 — Drafting Ya-Sin was a big miss by Ballard and company. He’s the only player selected first by the Colts within the last five years who’s no longer on the team. The 26-year-old started 13 games as a rookie but backslid in 2020 and 2021 before being traded to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Raiders</a> ahead of the 2022 season. Ya-Sin has only snagged two interceptions in 52 career games.</p><p>2018: <strong>G Quenton Nelson, </strong>pick No. 6 — Nelson has already established himself as one of the best offensive linemen in Colts history. The 27-year-old has been a Pro Bowler every year of his career and is a four-time All-Pro, highlighted by three first-team nods. He slipped a little last season, failing to earn an All-Pro selection for the first time. But assuming he bounces back in 2023, Nelson would continue what’s shaping up to be a Hall of Fame career.</p><p>(Top photo of Anthony Richardson: James Gilbert / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2xrcW9lZnxzfJFsZmlsX2eDcLXNnaCappGlvK210maaqKSkqHqvsstmm6uZlql6sbXCpKpmppWasbR5z6ucnaGTqbawutJmnq6hlJp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thank-god-its-friday-1978.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Thank God It's Friday movie review (1978)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-seat-wcsc-live-5-bio-wiki-age-husband-salary-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danielle Seat WCSC Live 5 Bio, Wiki, Age, Husband, Salary, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
