He also launched more than 10 congregations on university campuses around the United Kingdom.</p><p>On November 13, 2010, Drs.

Tomi believes that God has called him to edify countries through the prophetic word. He demonstrates this with the aid of his mobile worldwide ministry.</p><p>The prophet could gain notoriety in the future, and Wikipedia administrators might build a Tomi Arayomi Wikipedia page highlighting his accomplishments and age.</p><h2>Arrest of Tomi Arayomi</h2><p>Tomi Arayomi, an apostle of the Restoring Isaachers Generation (RIG), and his wife Tahmar Arayomi are rumored to have been arrested upon arriving at the Abuja airport.</p><p>A man called Emmanuel was seized along with the other two, Persecondnews reports. For a mission to the Federal Capital Territory that was scheduled to commence at 5:00 p.m. on April 7th, the party arrived at the airport at 10:20 a.m.</p><p>Sources learned that when they arrived, they were pulled away and their phones were taken, though the cause for their incarceration was not immediately evident.</p><p>Despite the fact that the cause of their imprisonment is unknown, speculation suggests that it is unrelated to a prophesy he made years before the general election of 2023, which many believe would have upset the ruling All Progressive Congress, or APC.</p><p>The DSS has not yet made an announcement confirming or disputing the arrest or outlining the reasons behind it.</p><p>His twin brother Tobi Arayomi made this announcement at midday on his Instagram account, @tobiarayomi. Tobi believes that Department of State Services officials held him as a result of what he claims were political predictions made by his brother.</p><p>After around 40 minutes, Tobi posted a picture of his brother and his wife on Instagram to herald their release.</p><p>Pastor Tomi was slated to attend a program on April 7 at his church’s Abuja location, according to information gleaned from his official Facebook page.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, David Bennent, Sal Capaccio, Isabel Arraiza and Elijah Nelson Clark."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":24}{"1":26,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":54}{"1":59,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":78}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/david-bennent/"}{"1":24}{"1":26,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sal-capaccio/"}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":"https://popularbio.com/isabel-arraiza/"}{"1":54}{"1":59,"2":"https://popularbio.com/elijah-nelson-clark/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>David Bennent</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sal Capaccio</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Isabel Arraiza</a> and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Elijah Nelson Clark</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Pastor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Lilly Singh Pregnant | Weight Gain Before And After</a></h3>Famous Canadian American actress, vlogger, YouTube personality, and talk show presenter Lilly Singh.
