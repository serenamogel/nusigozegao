He was previously Donald Whitfield’s attorney before becoming Banner Creighton’s.</strong></p><p>The oil tycoon requested that he release his henchman, Banner. Banner had previously attacked the Dutton family in a feud with Jacob Dutton. John Dutton Sr. was killed in the ambush, while Jacob, Elizabeth, and Jack were injured.</p><p>The injuries to Jack and Elizabeth were minor, but Jacob appeared to be dead for a while because his wounds were deep and lethal. Banner Creighton orchestrated the Dutton massacre. Banner was eventually apprehended for his crimes in episode 7 of 1923, but plans for his bail were already in the works. Donald Whitfield and Chadwick Benton are doing everything they can to get him out of jail and back on the Dutton property.</p><h2>Currie Graham is a popular television actor</h2><p>Currie Graham was born in Ontario, Canada on February 26, 1967. He went to Algonquin and Maynard Public Schools. When he was a child, his family relocated from Algonquin, Ontario to Cardinal, Ontario. He attended South Grenville District High School in Prescott, Ontario, before going on to study acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.</p><p>Currie is best known for his role as Lt. Thomas Bale in the final season of NYPD Blue. In the final season of Suddenly Susan, he even played the male lead/romantic interest Nate Knaborski. Among other shows, he has appeared in Nash Bridges, ER, The Big Easy, Pacific Blue, L.A. Doctors, CSI, 24, The Division, CSI: Miami, House, and Boston Legal.</p><p>At the 19th Gemini Awards in 2004, he was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role for his portrayal of Constable Robert Cross in the 2003 TV film Cowboys and Indians: The J.J. Harper Story, and he co-starred in the 2014 film Pompeii with Kit Harington. In 2015, he portrayed Mike Sherman in the hit AMC show Mad Men. In addition, he has appeared in Westworld and Marvel’s Agent Carter.</p><h2>What is the story of 1923 all about?</h2><p>The year is 1923, and the Great Depression devastated the majority of the United States of America. The Duttons faced difficulties in Montana not only due to the Great Depression but also because other Montanans attempted to take over the Dutton ranch. During this time, their main opponents were a shepherd-turned-henchman named Banner Creighton and a wealthy oil billionaire named Donald Whitfield.</p><p>According to the official synopsis of the show:</p><p><strong>“1923, a Yellowstone origin story, introduces a new generation of the Dutton family as they journey through the early twentieth century, when pandemics, catastrophic drought, the end of Prohibition, and the Great Depression all afflicted the mountain west and the Duttons who call it home.”</strong></p><p>In addition to Harrison Ford as Jacob Dutton and Helen Mirren as Cara Dutton, the series stars Julia Schlaepfer as Alexandra, Brandon Sklenar as Spencer Dutton, Jerome Flynn as Banner Creighton, Darren Mann as Jack Dutton, and Aminah Nieves as Teonna Rainwater.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
