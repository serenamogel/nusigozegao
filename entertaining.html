Five minutes ago it was summer, then the leaves were falling, then we had a bit of snow last week(!), so needless to say, it‚Äôs suddenly holiday season! Whether you‚Äôre hosting the big meal or you‚Äôve been assigned to bring a salad or side dish, here are a few recipe ideas. This is a short list of recipes that are my favorites right now. There are also tons more listed under the Thanksgiving tab of our recipe index. Start the meal off with this Butternut Squash Hummus. In my‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I love a good crudit√© platter. I feel like they get a bad rap because the grocery store versions with the sad celery, raw cauliflower, and grubby carrots are never the most exciting appetizer at a party, but this board fixes that by being bright, fun, and delicious! It‚Äôs a yummy mix of fresh things, salty/savory bites, and even a sweet element from the delectable Tart Cherry Thyme Compound Butter. Each little recipe is made up of super simple combinations of creative ingredients that, together, make a really unique crudit√© platter!

That sure came up quick! In case you need some recipe inspiration, here are a few of my favorites that I think would be perfect for the occasion. Plus, see below for an extra special giveaway üôÇ For brunch: I love these lightly sweet&nbsp;Coconut Mango Muffins.&nbsp;I often keep them in my freezer for a weekday breakfast or snack. To make them brunch-able, serve with the mini frittatas below: These little Mini Tomato Frittatas with Dill are as cute as they are delicious. I absolutely love the combo of dill and eggs.

Today I‚Äôm partnering with 14 Hands Wine to share some Derby Day party tips, recipes, and a few great wine pairings. It‚Äôs time break out your fancy hats, pour some wine and get started! First up are these colorful open-faced (crust off!) tea sandwiches. These are super easy to make if you make the spread ahead of time and assemble these just before your guests arrive. Instead of a cream cheese spread I made an herbal creamy dill spread by blending&nbsp;sunflower‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy&nbsp;almost-Thanksgiving week! Do you have your menu set? Are you getting together with family or having a Friendsgiving? Either way ‚Äì here‚Äôs a sweet and oh-so-pretty cocktail that would be lovely for your turkey day. This one couldn‚Äôt be easier: mix apple cider with iced tea, let it chill for about 2 hours with diced apples, cinnamon sticks and star anise. When your guests arrive, pull it out of the fridge and serve with sparkling wine. That‚Äôs it!</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>A few weeks ago I threw this simple, fun Friday night wine party. Here in Austin, it was the first day of fall (read: the first day that the temps dropped below 90 degrees)‚Ä¶ I invited some of my closest friends, served up some fall-inspired appetizers and (to keep things easy!) opened up a few boxes of Bota Box wines. Here was my menu: ‚Äì Roasted Butternut Squash Crostini w/ Sage ‚Äì Assorted Cheese Platter ‚Äì Pumpkin Hummus (recipe below) I roasted cubes of butternut squash and topped them onto crostini with lemon ricotta and fried sage.

How to Make Crostini Crostini may seem fancy, but making them is actually simple. If you‚Äôre not familiar with them, they‚Äôre thin slices of grilled or toasted baguette that are great for serving with a variety of toppings.

And what I really mean by that is I hope you have more exciting plans than we do. We‚Äôre pretty jet lagged so we‚Äôll probably be celebrating the red white and blue on the sofa with some Orange is the New Black. However,&nbsp;if I DO get up the energy to cook, I think this would be such a delicious veggie-forward summer menu: Pictured above: Baby Bella Veggie Kabobs Watermelon St. Germain Cocktails / Tomato Basil Peach Skewers Vegetarian Orzo Stuffed Peppers Chile Lime Grilled Corn on‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Is it Friday yet? I‚Äôm SO ready for the long weekend. After a whirlwind 2 days in Toronto this week promoting the book, I‚Äôm ready to relax, sleep in, and of course eat some yummy food! If you‚Äôre hosting (or heading to) a picnic or BBQ this weekend ‚Äì here are some very favorite Memorial Day veggie ideas: Pictured above: Portobello Tacos with Creamy Jalape√±o Sauce First things first, get your guests a cocktail! Mix up a big batch of this ginger peach sangria. It‚Äôs light and refreshing ‚Äì my favorite summer cocktail.

I don‚Äôt know where you live, but it‚Äôs been absolutely gorgeous around here lately so I‚Äôm going to brag about it a little bit. The sun is shining, colorful vegetables are showing up at&nbsp;the markets, and mint (a.k.a&nbsp;the only thing my black thumb can ‚Äúgrow‚Äù), is spreading like a weed in our yard. I‚Äôm not sure what our Easter brunch plans are yet, but I‚Äôm already looking forward to&nbsp;the&nbsp;weekend.

Last weekend, I loaded up on the prettiest brightly colored vegetables to put together a gorgeous yet easy&nbsp;wine party crudit√© appetizer spread. Two things always intimidate me about putting together party food: 1: Spending tons of time&nbsp;(and tons of money) putting together a guest-worthy spread, and 2: Picking out great wine.&nbsp;So today I have some tips&nbsp;for both‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs start with the wine (always my favorite place to start).
