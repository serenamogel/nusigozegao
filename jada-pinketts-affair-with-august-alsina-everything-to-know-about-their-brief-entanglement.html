While 2022 kickstarted the never-ending chatter around Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, there is another aspect of the couple’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly peaceful marriage</a> that continues to snag the spotlight — Pinkett’s short-lived but much-publicized “entanglement” with the “No Love” singer, August Alsina.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>While it has been years since the revelation that the Matrix star had been in a relationship with the two-decades younger R&B singer in the past, Alsina is definitely not over it. In 2022, the artist released a new song whose lyrics seemingly alluded to his short-lived romance with Pinkett Smith. And as expected, this served to trigger renewed interest in the former couple’s story.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>But it is not as if the questions their brief relationship continues to spark are ever in need of a fresh catalyst.</p><h2 id=h-jada-pinkett-and-august-alsina-s-entanglement data-injectable=false>Jada Pinkett and August Alsina’s “entanglement”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-and-August-Alsina-1.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Pinkett Smith and Alsina’s secret relationship came into the limelight back in 2020, when the singer appeared on the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Breakfast Club</a> to talk about his new album at the time. There is no denying that the most shocking portion of the chat was Alsina revealing to host Angela Yee that he had been in a relationship with Pinkett Smith “for years” after Will Smith allegedly gave him his “blessing” to continue it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>“I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership … he gave me his blessing,” he shared. It was in 2015 that Jaden Smith introduced Alsina to his family which was followed by the singer even vacationing with the Smiths in Hawaii. According to Alsina, he became very close to the actress during that time and fell in love with her.</p><p>“I totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life, and I truly and really, really deeply love and have a ton of love for her. I devoted myself to it, I gave my full self to it — so much so to the point that I can die right now and be okay with knowing that I truly gave myself to somebody. And I really loved a person, I experienced that and I know what that feels like — and some people never get that in this lifetime.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Post Alsina’s rather shocking revelation — as it was presumed that the Smiths were in a happy marriage when the singer dated the Gotham star — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> reached out to Pinkett Smith’s representatives, who were quick to respond that the story was “absolutely not true!!” This in turn prompted Alsina to defend his comments in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>“My truth is MY truth, & it’s mine to own,” he wrote. “There is no right or wrong here, it simply just IS. & I make room and have acceptance for your thoughts and opinions, regardless if I agree or not, you have that freedom to feel WHATEVER it is u feel because when you’re at TRUE peace, all of the noise and chatter becomes that of a whisper.”</p><h2 id=h-pinkett-smith-openly-admitted-her-relationship-with-alsina data-injectable=false>Pinkett Smith openly admitted her relationship with Alsina</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-e1695822333161.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>At the time, it seemed like the Bad Moms star would stick to her assertion that she never had anything to do with Alsina. But just days later, during an episode of her talk show, Red Table Talk, she and her husband Will Smith willingly addressed the speculations and confirmed that Pinkett Smith was indeed in a relationship with Alsina. The couple further clarified that it happened while they were separated for some time in 2015 as they were trying to figure out how to be happy on their own.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>“I was done with your ass. I was done with you,” Will shared, admitting that at the time it seemed like their marriage was over. “Marriages have that though. We decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I’ll try to figure out how to make myself happy. I really felt like we could be over,” he added.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Since they were not together, the actress entered into a relationship with Alsina — an “entanglement” to be precise.</p><p>“We were over. From there, as time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement with August.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>While she did confirm that it was a relationship, she explained that it was born of the fact that she was “in a lot of pain” and “was very broken.” It eventually made her realize that “you can’t find happiness outside of yourself.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>For Alsina, the Smiths remain his “family”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Will-Smith-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-e1695822162128.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>While Pinkett Smith and Will Smith more or less confirmed Alsina’s statement, they denied that the King Richard star actually gave him “permission” to date his wife. But apparently, as Pinkett Smith explained, the singer presumably “would perceive it as permission because [she and Smith] were separated amicably.”</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>Soon after, Alsina also seconded Pinkett Smith’s usage of the term “entanglement” to describe their relationship in a chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>, wherein he explained that he indeed had a “complicated dynamic” with the actress. He also shared that ever since he publicly talked about his and Pinkett Smith’s relationship, he has not been in contact with her. But assured that it doesn’t mean that it has affected his relationship with the Smiths.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>“I don’t have an issue with anybody. I love everybody. I love all of them/ They’ve been my family, and there’s a lot of history there. They’re beautiful people. They’re beautiful spirits. They really are. There’s no bad blood with anybody,” he explained. “They [the Smiths] got [the Angela Yee interview] way before the world ever saw it. It came from a loving place. There’s no bad love with anybody. I got love for everybody on this planet.”</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>While the Smiths have apparently moved on from this unexpected revelation and the subsequent headlines it made, not everyone is on the same page.</p><h2 id=h-alsina-is-not-done-talking-um-singing-about-pinkett-smith data-injectable=false>Alsina is not done talking — um, singing — about Pinkett Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/August-Alsina-e1695822186735.jpg><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>While the world is still busy discussing Will Smith’s Oscars fiasco and its long-term repercussions, Alsina released a new song, titled “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake the World</a>” in April 2022 where he seemingly referred to his relationship with Pinkett Smith.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>“Well, of course, some s**t is bound to go down when you tangled up with the world’s favorite,” sings the artist in the track.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=894 data-injectable=true>This is not the first time Alsina has tinkered with Pinkett Smith’s usage of the word “entanglement” and alluded to their relationship. Back in September 2020, a few weeks after he made his past relationship with Pinkett Smith public knowledge, he released a new single titled “Entanglements,” whose lyrics go as follows — “The definition of ‘entanglement’ is when you tangle in the sheets” and “Girl, I know that we don’t call it a relationship, but you’re still f**king with me.”</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>While Alsina may or may not be over Pinkett Smith, the Hollywood couple has made it clear that they will not be getting involved in any extramarital affairs of any sort. During the SAG Awards 2022, the couple appeared on the red carpet and when questioned if they will be engaging in “more entanglements” in the future, Pinkett Smith shot it down by responding that there will be “no more of those.”</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>But seeing that Alsina seemingly has no qualms when it comes to flaunting his brief relationship with Pinkett Smith as well as the fact that The Suicide Squad star and his wife don’t bother to react to his implicit references, there will be no “last time” when people are reminded that he once dated the Emmy-winning talk show host.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3orDAZqeippuawbW%2FjJqdn5mZp3q4tdOhZJqtl6rAtXnApaqippFisrex0bKroaGenHq1u4ykpaivXZavsMHTZquhnZmneqO%2ByJ6dZp2eqa6vs8uepJ6mpGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./monica-castillo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Monica Castillo biography &amp;amp; movie reviews</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-a-ups-store-mailbox-cost-per-month.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much does a ups store mailbox cost per month</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
