今年２０１８年いっぱいでの芸能界引退を発表されました。
７０歳といえば、
今日、星野仙一さんが死去されたばかり。
この年齢には何かがあるのでしょうか？
奥村チヨさんの芸能界引退は、
レコード会社を通じてファックスで発表され、
「ファンの皆様へ」と手紙形式の文章だったそうです。
最後の最後までアーティストであり続けるために、
奥村チヨさんは今年２０１８年を走り抜けると思いますが、
同い年に引退される安室奈美恵さんなどもおり、
今年で音楽界から姿を消す２人の行方に注目が集まります。
安室さんは４０歳という年齢で、
奥村チヨさんは７０歳という年齢で、
やはり女性というのは、年齢で区切りをつけたいものなのでしょうか？
奥村チヨが芸能界引退 奥村チヨさんが引退を発表されたFAXには、
手紙形式で、長年支えてくれたファンと、
そして周囲のスタッフに対する感謝の気持ちが込められてました。
「私 奥村チヨは1月24日発売のアルバムに新曲“サイレントムーン”を入れ 今年いっぱいで歌手活動を卒業する事を決心致しました」
今年２０１８年の１月２４日に新アルバムをリリースする奥村チヨさんですが、
新曲「サイレントムーン」を収録したことを強調しながらも、
今年いっぱいで歌手業を辞めることを明かしました。
７０歳という年齢でもしっかりと新しい曲を作り、
最後に有終の美を目指そうとする姿が、
長く支えた多くのファンの胸にしみることでしょう。
「今迄ファンの皆様そしてスタッフの皆様にささえられいつも元気を頂き本当に楽しくお仕事をさせて頂き大変幸福でした」と今までの歌手人生で、
みんなのおかげで楽しく活動ができていたことにも感謝しました。
ファックスの中には母をなくした２０１４年に、
本当は歌手活動を辞めようと思っていた心境も明かし、
これまでファンに明かさなかったことも多く綴られています。
年内での引退に向けて、
奥村チヨさんはどのような活動をするのか？
最後の最後にパワフルなライブをする姿を想像すると、
今からでも涙が出てきそうです・・・。
奥村チヨの現在の顔(シワシワ？)と旦那(夫)。画像 若い頃から男性の憧れ的存在でもあった奥村チヨさん。
歌手としての実力があるながらも、
多くの男性のファンを抱えていました。
年を重ねても、綺麗なその姿に、
多くの方が驚いていたことでしょう！
それでも、現在は７０歳。
年齢に勝てるといっても、限界があると・・・。
しかし、今現在の奥村チヨさんの姿を見てる、
とても７０歳には見えない美貌を誇っています！
肌年齢がいまだに３０代ということで、
昨年から、改めてその美容法に注目が集まっていました。
やはりパワフルに活動を続けてきたことが、
奥村チヨさんの若さを保ったのでしょうか？
また、旦那が作曲家の浜圭介さんだったことが、
常にステージに立つことに基準を向けた生活作りに成功したのかな？と。
旦那さんと二人三脚で歩んだ歌手人生だけに、
引退後は、二人でゆっくりと残りの時間を楽しむのでしょうか。
旦那さんと揃って、かっこいい夫婦って感じがした憧れますね！
