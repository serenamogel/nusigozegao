He’s one of the rare performers who is instantly recognizable, regardless of whether or not you know his name. He’s best known, of course, for his turn as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pee-wee Herman</a> in various films and TV shows, but Ruebens was a deceptively versatile actor who always managed to dominate the screen when he appeared.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Reubens <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">died on Monday</a>, and an official statement posted to his Facebook confirmed that his death was cancer-related. He was 70 years old. It’s a tragic loss, and yet, the actor left behind ensures that he will never be forgotten. Here is a rundown of Reubens’ most iconic movies and the streaming platforms on which you can view them.</p><h2 id=h-pee-wee-s-big-holiday-netflix data-injectable=false>Pee-wee’s Big Holiday (Netflix)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>It doesn’t get much bigger than Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985). The film was positioned to capitalize on the success of the TV special The Pee-wee Herman Show (1981). While it may have been gimmicky in the wrong hands, the inventiveness of Reubens and rookie director Tim Burton ensured it was anything but.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Pee-wee’s Big Holiday (2016) is the third and final Pee-wee movie, and despite taking place decades later, it manages to recapture the magic of its predecessors. Reubens is in top form, and his interactions with the likes of Joe Manganiello and Alia Shawkat remain some of the most side-splitting scenes in the trilogy.</p><h2 id=h-flight-of-the-navigator-disney-plus data-injectable=false>Flight of the Navigator (Disney Plus)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>A lesser-known Disney movie, but one that has developed a cult following since its release in 1986. Flight of the Navigator is about a boy who gets abducted by an alien spaceship and transported from 1978 to the year the film is set. The film is pretty cleverly written, and the supporting cast is made up of future stars like Veronica Cartwright, Sarah Jessica Parker, and, of course, Reubens.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>Reubens plays Max, the robotic commander of the ship, in what proved to foreshadow his career as a voice actor. You can hear bits and pieces of the Pee-wee voice in his performance as Max, but it’s still distinct enough to stand on its own.</p><h2 id=h-batman-returns-max data-injectable=false>Batman Returns (Max)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Burton and Reubens got on famously during the making of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, so when it came time for the director to cast the father of the villainous Penguin in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Returns</a> (1992), he knew Reubens was the man for the job. The actor is only on screen for a few minutes (it’s basically a cameo), but he couldn’t be further away from the character that made him famous.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>He dons a monocle, white facial hair, and a snobby, callous attitude toward his infant (albeit unseen) son. When the most kid-friendly actor in your film throws an infant off of a Gotham bridge, you know you’re in for a different viewing experience.</p><h2 id=h-the-nightmare-before-christmas-disney-plus data-injectable=false>The Nightmare Before Christmas (Disney Plus)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>The third, final, and arguably most famous collaboration between Burton and Reubens. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) is a certified <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday classic</a>, whether you prefer to watch it during Halloween or Christmas. Ruebens voices Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>He doesn’t have a ton of screen time, but he makes the most of it and subsequently reprises the role during live fundraiser performances of the movie. Burton doesn’t direct The Nightmare Before Christmas (he writes and produces; Henry Sellick directs), but he continues to prove that he knew how to use Reubens better than anyone.</p><h2 id=h-life-during-wartime-tubi data-injectable=false>Life During Wartime (Tubi)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>A definite change of pace from Reubens’ earlier works. Life During Wartime (2009) is an ensemble dramedy about a group of dysfunctional people and a loose sequel to the movies Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) and Happiness (1998). It’s not light viewing, but then again, writer-director Todd Solandz is not in the habit of telling easily digestible stories.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>Reubens plays Andy, a co-worker of one of the main characters who technically died before the movie’s events but continues to appear in feverish visions. The actor rebukes all his usual tricks and gives a sad, straightforward performance that stands out in a cast that includes Allison Janney, Michael K. Williams, and Charlotte Rampling.</p><h2 id=h-teacher-s-pet-disney-plus data-injectable=false>Teacher’s Pet (Disney Plus)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Reubens continued to be a prolific voice actor in the 21st century. He knew how to make supporting characters pop and deliver a line of dialogue in such a way that it stuck in the viewer’s minds. That’s what he manages to do in Teacher’s Pet (2004).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>The big-screen sequel to the TV show of the same name, Teacher’s Pet, is a fun outing punctuated by Reubens’ bizarre turn as Dennis. There’s lots of vocal firepower in the cast thanks to Kelsey Grammer, Nathan Lane, and Jerry Stiller, but Reubens once again comes out on top.</p><h2 id=h-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-max data-injectable=false>Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Max)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Not as famous as the show, but still a great time. Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) condenses the plot from the aforementioned show and, in doing so, opens the door for hilariously dark interactions between the titular character (Kristy Swanson) and the vampires she slays. One of these vampires is Amilyn, played with absolute commitment by Reubens.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>He not only looks silly, but his death scene (not a spoiler since he’s already undead) is arguably the most hilarious moment in the film. Amilyn takes a wooden stake to the chest, looks around incredulously, and then sinks to the ground. Once again, a scene-stealing performance.</p><h2 id=h-beauty-and-the-beast-the-enchanted-christmas-disney-plus data-injectable=false>Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (Disney Plus)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>An underrated sequel, as far as straight-to-video Disney movies are concerned. Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997) reunites most of the cast from the original, but it’s the additions, particularly Reubens, that help the movie establish itself as a worthwhile viewing experience.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Reubens plays Fife, a minion of the new main villain who turns out to have a good heart. In the end, Fife winds up becoming the court composer, in what proves to be the most satisfying character arc in the whole movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6rpGK9osHLZqmerZKau7R5zKitop2jYryvec2eq5%2Bkma16pbXSp5yyZaChwrR5wKebZqWRrXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./causeway-movie-review-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Causeway movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2022)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-muffin-tops-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Is Making Muffin Tops| Sporked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./austin-sprinz-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-40722-html.html>Austin Sprinz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo.html>Cristiano Ronaldo - Team, Kids &amp;amp; Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./snoop-dogg-height.html>Snoop Dogg Height: How Tall Is The Legendary Rapper?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./swoon-1992.html>Swoon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./donald-cleary-obituary-how-did-donald-cleary-die.html>Donald Cleary Obituary: How Did Donald Cleary Die?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog.
